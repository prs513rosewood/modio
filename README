Modio is a simple audio player for Mac OS X. It is a non-interactive program, so you can run it in background. It can read playlists.

Here is the playlist syntax :

Beacause modio needs the full path to a file, the character ':' supplies a directory. Then modio searches for files in that directory.
The character '>' supplies a song. ">>" supplies the whole content of a directory indicated by ':'.
The character '!' indicates the reading mode. If the string following '!' contains "rand" or "loop", the mode is changed. Note that you can supply both "rand" and "loop".

Example :

!(rand | loop)
:/Users/prs513rosewood/Music
>Asturias.mp3
>Prelude 1.m4a
:/Users/Shared/Music
>Study.mp3
:/Users/Shared/MyFavArtist
>>

In the "!(rand | loop)" string, only '!', "rand" and "loop" are important.
